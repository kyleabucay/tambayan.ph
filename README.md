# 📌 About This Project
Hello! This is a personal project I created using the lessons I’ve learned from Scrimba’s React course. The technologies used are Vanilla CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. I also integrated Firebase Authentication, as I haven’t explored backend development yet.

If you happen to come across this repository, feel free to suggest improvements or point out any bugs I might have missed!

# 💡 Inspiration
The idea for this app was inspired by someone who built a restaurant-finding app that tracks nearby restaurants and displays reviews and menus. My version takes a more student-focused approach.

It’s specifically designed for students in my hometown who are moving to the city for school. The goal is to help them find comfortable and budget-friendly places to live without the hassle.

# 🍽️ Bonus Feature: Carinderia Finder
I also included a Carinderia feature to help students find affordable, nutritious, and delicious meals—perfect for tight student budgets.
